# Prerequisites

## Docker Installations
You can install Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Choose the appropriate installers for your host machine and follow the instructions mentioned for the host platform.  MacOS: You can get the dmg file for Docker [here](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac). 

Note: If you are using Docker Desktop for Mac / Docker Desktop for Windows , it is recommended to increase the Memory resource to **at-least 8GB**. Please find the reference for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/) / [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/).

Once you have Docker installed, ensure that you are running the daemon. If you want to tune and configure docker, please find detailed information [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/)

## Docker-Compose Installations
**Note** : If you are using Docker Desktop for Mac / Docker Desktop for Windows, then docker-compose comes bundled with docker and you need not follow the below steps. But make sure to disable Experimental Features for docker-compose from your Docker Dashboard preferences. For other operating systems, you can install docker compose from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Currently Bahmni has been tested on **docker-compose version 1.29.2**. If you are using older versions of docker-compose, please upgrade to the latest version. You can check docker compose version by running `docker-compose version`

## Adding SSL Certificate
A self signed OpenSSL Certificate has been generated and bundled in the `bahmni-proxy` image. You can generate your own certificate and volume mount the folder containing the certificate to `/etc/tls` by uncommenting the lines in `docker-compose.yml`. 
```
volumes: 
   - ${CERTIFICATE_PATH}:/etc/tls
```
Replace the `${CERTIFICATE_PATH}` to the path at which the certificate and key file are present. Also make sure to name the certificate file as `cert.pem` and key file as `key.pem`

Note: Self-signed certificates are inherently not trusted by your browser because a certificate hasn't signed by trusted Certificate Authority

To generate a trusted SSL Certificate, required dependencies bundled in the `bahmni-proxy` image. You need to run the following command. It will generate certificate and replace it with `/etc/tls/cert.pem` and `/etc/tls/key.pem`
```
docker exec -it {{PROXY_CONTAINER_NAME/ID}} sh -c \
   "certbot certonly --webroot -w /usr/local/apache2/htdocs -d {{DOMAIN_NAME}} --email {{EMAIL}} \
      --agree-tos --noninteractive ;
   cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{DOMAIN_NAME}}/fullchain.pem /etc/tls/cert.pem ;
   cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/{{DOMAIN_NAME}}/privkey.pem /etc/tls/key.pem"
``` 
Restart the proxy container `docker restart {PROXY_CONTAINER_NAME/ID}}`

# Setup Centralised Logging
>```Note: This is an optional configuration and is needed only when centralised logging with Loki Stack is needed.```

### 1. Install Loki Logging Driver
[Loki stack](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) uses Loki [Docker Driver Client](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/docker-driver/) for getting logs of container and pushing to Loki.
Run the following command to install the driver or take a look [here](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/docker-driver/#installing).
```shell
docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest --alias loki --grant-all-permissions
```

### 2. Update Logging Method in docker-compose.yml
The default configuration of docker-compose ships with default logging that is configured in docker daemon. 

To enable loki logging for the services, in the docker-compose file find the `x-log-config` section and update the value from `*default` to `*loki`

### 3. Start Loki stack services
Now loki stack services can be started by running,
```shell
docker-compose --profile logging up -d
```

### 4. Viewing Logs
- Now navigate to `https://localhost/grafana` and login with `admin` as username and password and reset your password.
- Next click on [Explore Icon ](https://grafana.com/static/img/docs/explore/access-explore-7-4.png) in the Grafana Left Panel.
- Use the log browser to choose label as `compose_service` and value with the container needed, then Click on `Run Query` on the top right of the screen. This will show the current logs.
- You can also click on `Live` on the top right to see the live stream of the logs.

### 5. Logs retention
- We can retain logs & customised retention duration as per our needs. Follow [documentation ](https://bahmni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BAH/pages/3090251784/Monitoring+Grafana+Loki+-+Persistent+logs) to implement log retention.

# Profile Configuration
Bahmni docker-compose has been configured with profiles which allows you to run the required services. More about compose profiles can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/). The list of different profiles can be found below.

Note: `proxy,bahmni-config` are generic services and it will start always irrespective of below profiles.

| Profile               | Application                          | Services                                  |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|

Profiles can be set by changing the `COMPOSE_PROFILES` variable in .env variable. You can set multiple profiles by comma seperated values.
Example: COMPOSE_PROFILES=openelis,odoo. You can also pass this as an argument with docker-compose up command. Example: `docker-compose --profile odoo up` (or) `docker-compose --profile odoo --profile openelis up`

# Running Bahmni with default images

### Starting all Bahmni Components
1. Navigate to `bahmni-docker` directory in a terminal. For Colima users, start with `colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8`
2. Run `docker-compose up` .
    This pulls default images from docker hub and starts the application with demo database. Also `docker-compose up -d` can be used to run in detach mode.
3. After the containers spin up, you will be able to access different components at below mentioned configurations.

**Note:**
* When Bahmni docker-compose comes up, it reads the `.env` for all configuration settings like DB name, URL, ports, credentials, etc. You can change those to suit your needs. For more details on configuration options, see [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration).
* By default the docker containers use Demo database image. One can also choose a fresh DB, but recommended to use demoDB if you are new to Bahmni and wish to have some pre-created master data, forms, terminology and patients. 
* To see the list of existing patients in Bahmni, go to Bahmni web UI, Registration Module, and for Patient Name type "%" (percentage sign) in the search box.

### Cleaning All Bahmni Application Data
Warning: Do this step carefully! This will lead to loss of database and application data.
* From the `bahmni-docker` directory in a terminal run, `docker-compose down -v` . This brings down the containers and destroys the *volumes* attached to the containers.

# Generating architecture diagram from docker-compose
To generate architecture diagram from docker-compose, run `sh generate_architecture_diagram.sh` command. 
While running this command, arguments can be passed to generate customized diagram. There are three options available:
1. --no-networks
2. --no-ports
3. --no-volumes

Example:
```shell
sh generate_architecture_diagram.sh --no-volumes --no-networks
```

The diagram will be generated inside the architecture-diagram directory and if there is any existing diagram it will replace it with the newly generated diagram.

# One-time Setup for Odoo
The below steps needs to be performed only once when Odoo is created.
1. Once the container spins up, login to the application.
2. Navigate to `Apps` from the menu bar.
3. Click on `Bahmni Account` app and then click on `Upgrade`.
4. Wait for the upgrade to complete and you will redirected to home page.
5. After redirection, refresh your page once.

Now Odoo should be working fine. If you don't see old patient data coming into Odoo in 10 mins, please read [Odoo not synchronizing old patient data](#odoo-not-synchronizing-old-patient-data)

# One-time Setup for OpenMRS:
The below steps needs to performed only once after OpenMRS application is loaded.
1. When OpenMRS is completely loaded, login to the application at `<host>/openmrs`
2. Navigate to Administration -> Maintenance -> Search Index.
3. In that page click on `Rebuild Search Index`
4. This rebuilds concept index of OpenMRS application.

# One-time Setup for Crater:
If you don't wish to do let crater do automatic installation, you can set the `CRATER_AUTO_INSTALL` to `"false"` an follow the below steps:
1. Open your web browser and go to your given domain (http://localhost:81) and follow the installation wizard.
2. On Installation wizard - Database setup, use below credentials:
    - Database Host: craterdb
    - Database Name: crater
    - Database Username: crater
    - Database Password: crater
3. In the later steps, create a super admin for crater and configure the Hospital as a Company.

# Odoo not synchronizing old patient data
Perform the followinng steps if older patient data is not being sent to Odoo. This likely happened because the ATOM Feed reader has already exhausted its max retry limit for failed events (by default set to 5 times). You can set the Failed events retry back to 1, and that should sync them immediately. Steps to fix this:
1. Open terminal in your local machine, in `bahmni-docker` folder.
2. Execute `docker ps` to see the list of running containers.
3. Connect to the Odoo postgres DB container by executing the command: `docker container exec -it  bahmni-docker_odoodb_1  /bin/bash`
where `bahmni-docker_odoodb_1` is the name of the odoo postgres container. You should now be within the container. 
4. Connect to the postgres console using command: `psql -Uodoo odoo`. For more info on how to connect to Bahmni Databases, refer to this wiki page: [Connecting to various databases](https://bahmni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BAH/pages/49545219/Connecting+to+various+databases).
5. In the psql prompt type: `select count(*) from failed_events;` This will show you the number of failed events. 
6. If 1 or more events are there, then you can fire the query: `select id,retries from failed_events;`. You should see all failed events have reached their retry limit.
7. Fire an *update* statement to reset the retry count for all failed events: `update failed_events set retries=1;`
8. Now in about a minute, all failed events should be processed and old patient data should get synced to Odoo.
9. To exit the container, first type `\q` to exit postgres shell, and then type `exit` to exit bash shell without stopping the postgres container. 



# Overriding Default Config
The default configuration comes with [default-config](https://github.com/Bahmni/default-config) image running in bahmni-config service. The configurations will be shared across services like OpenMRS, bahmni-web, openelis, reports.

To override default-config with your implementation specific configuration, it is recommended to build a docker image of your config and use it with the bahmni-config service. 

The steps to build the docker image for your implementation specific config can be found [here](https://github.com/Bahmni/default-config#docker-image-build). Once you have the docker image built you need to update `Bahmni Config Environment Variables` in the [.env](./.env) file.

### Local development on config
If you are doing local development on configuration, you can mount your local folder also. Follow the step below.
1. Update the `CONFIG_VOLUME` variable in the .env file with the path of your local config folder.
2. Comment `bahmni-config` service in docker-compose.yml
3. Update / Start the containers by running `docker-compose up -d`. If you use any profile, pass the profile option as well.

Note: In production, it is recommended to use a docker image for bahmni-config service.

# Environment Configuration:
* The list of configurable environment variables can be found in the `.env` file.
* The `.env ` file can be modified to customise the application.

## Atomfeed Configurations:
The default values specified for the below variables are for services running in Docker. It is recommened to update only when you need to connect with a service running in a different host. (Example: Vagrant).
Note: When connected with a different host, the master data should match. Otherwise you may face issues with atomfeed sync.

# Proxy Service
The proxy service runs with every profile configuration. It renders the Bahmni Landing Page. Also ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse configurations are done with this container.

# Patient Documents Service
The patient-documents service validates the session and checks the user's privileges before rendering patient documents. Currently the user is checked to have one of the following privileges 
* app:clinical
* app:patient-documents 
* app:document-upload

# Loading Additional Addons to Odoo
When you want to load additional addons to Odoo instance, you can set the EXTRA_ADDONS_PATH with the directory that contains your modules.
1. Bring down Odoo if it is already running by doing docker-compose down .
2. Set the path of your root directory of modules to EXTRA_ADDONS_PATH variable.
3. Restart Odoo instance by running `docker-compose up`
4. Login to the application
5. Navigate to `Settings` page in the web and enable Developer Mode
6. Navigate to Apps page and Click on `Update Apps List`
7. Your new module will be listed and you can install it.

For example you can download Open HRMS modules from [here](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/10.0/ohrms_core/) which provides a complete HR Management System. You need to extract the downlooaded zip file and set the extracted folder path to EXTRA_ADDONS_PATH.

Note: Make sure the addons are compatible with Odoo v10.0

# Developing Bahmni Odoo Modules
Note: Do these steps only if you need to update Bahmni Odoo modules.

1. Clone the *Bahmni/odoo-modules* repo at https://github.com/Bahmni/odoo-modules.git
2. Bring Bahmni down by running `docker-compose down -v` from `bahmni-docker` directory.
3. Update the `BAHMNI_ODOO_MODULES_PATH` variable in .env file with the cloned directory path. Also update COMPOSE_PROFILE=odoo so that only odoo services start.
4. Now in `docker-compose.yml` uncomment the volume commented under odoo service.
5. Start Odoo services by running `docker-compose up`
6. Enable developer mode in Odoo by navigating to `Settings` page in Odoo Web and click `Activate the Developer Mode`
7. After you perform a change, do the following steps to reflect the changes.
8. Run `docker-compose restart odoo`
9. Now in the browser navigate to `Apps` menu. Click on the app that is updated and click `Upgrade`.
10. Now you should see the changes reflected. If not try from Step 8 & 9 once again.

# Debugging OpenMRS Application
Since OpenMRS is running on Tomcat, remote debugging can be enabled and can be connected with IDE supporting remote debugging.(Eclipse, Intellij IDEA etc.)

1. Enable debugging by setting `OMRS_DEV_DEBUG_PORT` to some port (e.g 8000) in the `.env` file
2. Now remote debugging for OpenMRS is exposed on port `OMRS_DEV_DEBUG_PORT` in your local machine.
3. Now you can follow the IDE configuration to setup remote debugging using host as `localhost` and port as the value of `OMRS_DEV_DEBUG_PORT`. 
4. For example in Intellij IDEA navigate to Run -> Edit Configurations. In the dialog box click on `+` icon to create a new config and select `Remote JVM Debug`. Fill in the host,port and name and click Apply. Now you can use the debugger.

    > ```⚠ Make sure to disable debugging by setting the variable to false if you are running in a Production Environment```

# Adding/ Upgrading OpenMRS Modules
OpenMRS modules can be added or upgraded through the OpenMRS Web Interface.

Note: Method 1 is the recommended approach for managing modules.

*Method 1:*
1. Set the `OPENMRS_MODULE_WEB_ADMIN` variable to `true` in the .env file.
2. Restart OpenMRS by running the follwoing commands from the directory where docker-compose file is present.
    >`docker-compose rm -s -v openmrs`

    > `docker-compose up openmrs`
3. Navigate to Administration --> Manage Modules
4. Click on Add or Upgrade module
4. When you want to add a new module click on `Choose file` in the Add Module section and then select your .omod file.
5. When you want to add a new module click on `Choose file` in the Upgrade Module section and then select your .omod file.
6. Then click on Upload. OpenMRS will pick up the new module and will be available to use.
7. The modules folder has been volume mounted and will persist until you remove your volume.

*Method 2:*

Note: Use this approach only when you want to manage all Bahmni OpenMRS module OMODS from Host machine.

**Prerequisite:**
You need to download or build bahmni distro zip before proceeding.

1. Extract bahmni distro zip to a directory in the host machine.
2. Set the path of the directory to `BAHMNI_OPENMRS_MODULES_PATH` in .env file.
3. Comment the openmrs-data volume in docker-compose under openmrs service.
4. Uncomment the host mounted volume in docker-compose under openmrs service.
5. After uncommenting, recreate OpenMRS by running the below commands from the directory where docker-compose is found.
    >`docker-compose rm -s -v openmrs`

    > `docker-compose up openmrs`
6. Now OpenMRS picks up omods from the host mounted directory.

# Development on Bahmni UI
When you want to develop or modify bahmni UI code, you can follow these steps.
1. Clone the [openmrs-module-bahmniapps](https://github.com/Bahmni/openmrs-module-bahmniapps) repository in your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions in the README of the repository to install the required tools and dependencies.
3. Copy the path of `openmrs-module-bahmniapps` directory and set it to `BAHMNI_APPS_PATH` environment variable in the .env file. Do not add / at the last.
4. Now open the docker-compose.yml file and in the bahmni-web service uncomment the volumes section with the volumes starting with BAHMNI_APPS_PATH.
5. You can start the application by running `docker-compose up`. If you have your container already running, you need to recreate it so that the volume mounted code is used. To recreate bahmni-web container run the following command from bahmni-docker directory.

    `docker-compose up -d bahmni-web`

6. Now, when you refresh your browser, you should be able to see the changes reflected.

**Note:** If your change is not reflected, it could be because your browser would be rendering it from its cache. Try the same in Incognito or after clearing cached data. Also for development it is recommended to disable caching in the browser. Go to `Inspect` and then navigate to `Network` tab where you can find `Disable Cache` checkbox.

# Development on Appointments Frontend
When you want to develop on appointments frontend code, follow the below steps.
1. Clone the [openmrs-module-appointments-frontend](https://github.com/Bahmni/openmrs-module-appointments-frontend) repository in your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions in the README of the repository to install the required tools and dependencies.
3. Copy the path of `openmrs-module-appointments-frontend` directory and set it to `APPOINTMENTS_PATH` environment variable in the .env file. Do not add / at the last.
4. Now open the docker-compose.yml file and in the appointments service uncomment the volumes section.
5. Start / Recreate appointments service by doing
    >docker-compose up -d appointments
6. For every change you make, build the appointments code and the changes will reflect on refresh of the browser.

# Development Setup for Implementer Interface
1. Clone the [implementer-interface](https://github.com/Bahmni/implementer-interface) repository in your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions in the README of the repository to install the required tools and dependencies.
3. Copy the path of `implementer-interface` directory and set it to `IMPLEMENTER_INTERFACE_CODE_PATH` environment variable in the .env file. Do not add / at the last.
4. Now open the docker-compose.yml file and in the implementer-interface service uncomment the volumes section. 
5. You can start implementer-interface by running `docker-compose up -d implementer-interface`. If your container is already running, you need to recreate it by the following command. `docker-compose rm -s implementer-interface && docker-compose up -d implementer-interface`
6. Now, when you have implementer-interface build running in watch mode, you should be able to see the changes on refresh of the browser. 

# Adding Custom Reports
1. When you want to add custom reports to Bahmni Reports, add the config directory path to the `BAHMNI_CONFIG_PATH` variable. Make sure to follow the directory structure of [default-config](https://github.com/Bahmni/default-config).
2. Now open the docker-compose.yml file and in the reports service uncomment the volumes section.
3. You can start reports by running `docker-compose up -d reports`. If your container is already running, you need to recreate it by the following command. `docker-compose rm -s reports && docker-compose up -d reports`
4. Now, when you have reports running, you should be able to access the reports on refresh of the browser.

# Setting Up PACS
PACS setup of Bahmni uses DCM4CHEE. You can read more about it [here](https://bahmni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BAH/pages/32014588/Radiology+and+PACS+Integration).

In docker compose we use two different profiles `pacs` and `pacs-simulator`.

When the `pacs` profile is started, and when an order is made from Bahmni -> Consultation -> Orders -> Radiology Order you will be able to see the orders in `Modality Worklist` of DCM4CHEE / PACS.
There is a one-time setup in OpenMRS that needs to be done to view Radiology Images properly. Refer 4th point in this [Wiki Page](https://bahmni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BAH/pages/36077574/Setup+DCM4CHEE+Server+with+Oviyam2)
### Using PACS Simulator
There are two ways of uploading a DICOM image against a PACS order.

#### 1. Manually upload DICOM Images
First find out the patient id, patient first name, patient last name and accession number of the order from modality worklist page of DCM4CHEE.
Now from your terminal navigated to the bahmni-docker directory run the following command after replacing the appropriate values.
```shell
docker compose run pacs-simulator sh -c './upload.sh DCM4CHEE@dcm4chee:11112 <PATIENT_ID> <PATIENT_FIRST_NAME> <PATIENT_LAST_NAME> <ACCESSION_NUMBER>'
```
An example command would look like

`docker compose run pacs-simulator sh -c './upload.sh DCM4CHEE@dcm4chee:11112 GAN203010 Test Radiology ORD-329'`

#### 2. Automated Method by running PACS-Simulator
The PACS Simulator service can also be started in a listen mode by running `docker-compose --profile pacs-simulator up -d`.
When `pacs-simulator` profile is started, the order would be received by pacs-simulator service and a sample DICOM image will be uploaded to DCM4CHEE by pacs-simulator. And the completed order can be found in `Folder` tab of DCM4CHEE and also in Oviyam viewer. Now the orders will not be visible in Modality Worklist.

❗_Note:_ When pacs-simulator is started, it will update entries in `pacs_integration_db` modality table. Now when you want to receive the orders back in DCM4CHEE Modality Worklist make sure to update the modality table by running the below commands.
```
docker compose stop pacs-simulator
docker compose exec -it pacsdb sh
psql -U ${PACS_INTEGRATION_DB_USERNAME} -d ${PACS_INTEGRATION_DB_NAME} -c "UPDATE modality set ip='dcm4chee',port=2575 where id=1;"
exit 
```


# Common Troubleshooting Steps

### OpenMRS shows UI Module Not Found / OpenMRS shows Exception
- The reason for this error would be the OMODS are not loaded properly. This could happen because of inssuficient memory during initial startup by OpenMRS.
- **Fix**: Make sure you have increased your docker resources. Then try restarting OpenMRS alone with `docker-compose restart openmrs`
